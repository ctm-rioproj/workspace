        <p>
            My name is Cameron Moxley-Morris. I am a student looking to get an associate's degree in Computer Science here at Rio Salado.
            I've learned about various programming languages and have taken a few classes on them, so I have familiarity with Java, Python, Javascript, and C/C++.
            I have a bit of experience in HTML and CSS, but I'm looking to expand my knowledge. When I have free time, I enjoy working on cars and cycling. I am interested in 
            graphic design as well, so sometimes I experiment with certain design programs like GIMP and Krita as well.
