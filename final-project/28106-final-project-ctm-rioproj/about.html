                <h3>About Us</h3>
                <p>
                    Formed in 2025, we are a US-based nonprofit disaster relief organization. Despite the presence of federal emergency relief, recovery efforts 
                    are often limited in low-income and remote areas. These communities, which need help the most, are often left to fend for themselves after 
                    accidents. While insurance may be able to pay for repairs, these repairs may not happen for quite some time. This is why the Disaster Recovery 
                    Group was formed. Staffed primarily by volunteers, we aim to provide rapid repairs and cleanup to these areas that are often left behind. 
                    Simply living outside a major city is no reason that people should be deprived of the same treatment as others, and we aim to help everyone get 
                    back on their feet, one repair at a time.
